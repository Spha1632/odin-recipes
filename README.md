# odin-recipes

In this project i was creating a webpage of my favourite recipe

The skills i demonstrated in this project are:
using anchor tag
using heading tags (h1 and h2)
using img tag
href, src and target attribute

i just finished the intro to css so i am going to attempt to add a bit of style to my website like: 
changing the font
centre aligning text
